# SnakeGame
This is a snake game i built using Python and the windows-curses Module. 
I used Curses to creat a window object inside the terminal provided by Windows, GNU/Linux an other OS

# still need to add some features to the game :
    - score system 
    - UI (start , Pause...)
    - colors 
    - obstacles 
    - snake appear on the opposite side when he hit a screen border
