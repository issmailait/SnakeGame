i still did't figure out yet how to add UI elements to the game, so consider this as control options LOL:

to move the snake use:
 - RIGHT,LEFT,UP,DOWN keys on the keyboard
 
 if you hold down one of the keys the speed of the snake will increase
 
 the speed also increase each time you eat the food
